# Data-analysis-Python-project
This project analyzes the famous Titanic disaster dataset to uncover insights into passenger survival rates. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset is explored to identify patterns based on factors like age, gender, class, and embarkation point.The project involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand the key factors that influenced survival during the disaster.



#  Titanic Dataset Data Analysis Project

## Summary

The Titanic Dataset Data Analysis Project is a comprehensive exploration of the passenger data from the tragic sinking of the Titanic in 1912. This project leverages Python's powerful data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. The primary goal of this analysis is to investigate the factors that influenced passenger survival rates and present findings through data visualization and statistical summaries.

The dataset consists of information about passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class (Pclass), embarkation point, fare, number of siblings/spouses aboard, and number of parents/children aboard. The initial step of the project involves data cleaning by handling missing values and transforming categorical data into numerical format for easier analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of data and uncover patterns. Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib highlight correlations between passenger characteristics and survival rates. Key insights reveal that women and children had a higher likelihood of survival, while passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) were more likely to survive compared to those in lower classes.

Statistical analysis is applied to quantify the significance of these findings, using correlation matrices and hypothesis testing. The project also includes feature engineering to create new variables, such as family size, to enhance the predictive analysis.

The final report presents a detailed summary of findings, with graphs and charts supporting the conclusions. The Titanic Dataset Data Analysis Project not only demonstrates how data analysis can provide valuable insights from historical events but also serves as a practical example of applying Python programming and data science techniques to real-world datasets.

This project helps develop essential skills in data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning model preparation, making it a great portfolio piece for aspiring data analysts.
